<p>In this article, know what it takes to convert an html template into a react web application that functions as modern single page  application. I will cover brief introduction of our process, time and cost involved when you want to convert your html into react web application. </p>

<h3>Before we start with <a href="https://www.faciletechnolab.com/software-development-technology/react-development" title="react web application design and development">react web application design and development</a></h3>
<p>It is most common practice of <a href="https://www.faciletechnolab.com" title="custom software development">custom software development</a> to create some sort of UI prototype, wire-frame or graphic design at the beginning of the project to create good vision and share it across the team. In this article we are assuming you have either PSD or any other popular image format or html web template. Here I will demonstrate you what it takes to convert an HTML web template to fully working <a href="https://www.faciletechnolab.com/software-development-technology/react-development" title="React modern single page web application development">React modern single page web application development</a>.<br/></p>
<h3>What is your <a href="https://www.faciletechnolab.com/software-development-technology/react-development" title="Modern single page application development stack for react web application design and development">Modern single page application development stack for react web application design and development</a>?</h3>
<p>Modern single page applications are fast, responsive to the user interaction, easy to use and uses cutting edge technologies to optimize end user experience. There are many was you can <a href="https://www.faciletechnolab.com/software-development-technology/react-development" title="Modern single page application development stack for react web application design and development">create modern single page web application development</a>, but we are going to use following stack:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="noindex nofollow" target="_blank">React</a> is one of the most widely used front end JavaScript UI library that provides V part of the MVC based JavaScript application development. React is popular because of its high performance, declarative and component-based nature. We will be using npm packages like react, react-dom, react-router.</li>
	<li><a href="https://redux.js.org/" rel="noindex nofollow" target="_blank">Redux</a> is a state management library and mostly used with <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="noindex nofollow" target="_blank">React</a> due to many benefits like predictable and centralized application state management, single object tree for state, out of the box hot reloading and easy debugging etc.</li>
	<li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" rel="noindex nofollow" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> is used to easily create cross device responsive html pages. We can also use <a href="https://material-ui.com/" rel="noindex nofollow" target="_blank">material-ui</a> for the same purpose.</li>
	<li><a href="https://fontawesome.com/" rel="noindex nofollow" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> is used for beautiful css based icons.</li>
</ul>
<br/>You generally use <a href="https://expressjs.com/" rel="noindex nofollow" target="_blank">Express.js</a> for back-end API development stack but since we are only focusing on <a href="https://www.faciletechnolab.com/software-development-technology/react-development" title="React.js application development">React.js application development</a> in this article, we are not implementing back-end API.

<h3>What approach will you take for react web application design?</h3>
<p>Being an <a href="https://www.faciletechnolab.com/software-development-technology/react-development" title="expert React development team">expert React development team</a>, we approach the conversion to reduce future work as much as possible. This takes a little more effort during conversion, but the resulting output react web application will be easy to make dynamic. <br/>
Here are key aspects of our approach:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>1.	Setting up project using most common create-react-app to avoid manual boilerplate web app setup. Remove any/all npm references that are not required from the project.</li>
	<li>2.	Review all the pages to be converted and identify shared/common components that are required on more than one pages.</li>
	<li>3.	Setup redux and use services to provide hard coded data from the services instead of manually copy-paste html content from the source html.</li>
	<li>4.	Respect react development best practices and use ESLint, TSLint and formatting plugins to keep code tidy. </li>
	<li>5.	Minimal comments where required (which can be tweaked to detailed comments upon request)</li>
	<li>6.	Test in latest Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers to ensure best desktop results.</li>
	<li>7.	Test in Google Chrome emulator for phone and tablet size rendering and ensure best tablet and mobile results.</li>
</ul>
<br/></p>
<h3>What process do you follow for react web application design?</h3>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.faciletechnolab.com/software-development-technology/react-development" title="react web application design">react web application design</a> is complex process, but we can provide you a brief detail of our process of 
<a href="https://www.faciletechnolab.com/software-development-technology/react-development" title="react web application design">react web application design</a>. Here is quick overview:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>1.	Project Setup - <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" rel="noindex nofollow" target="_blank">create-react-app from Facebook</a>, add and configure libraries, run the application, and see the default page.</li>
	<li>2.	Shared Setup – Create shared components like header, footer and any other components identified during design review.</li>
	<li>3.	Create page – Create components required for a specific page.</li>
	<li>4.	Connect page component events, services and reducers.</li>
	<li>5.	Test the page – Test the resulting page in required browsers and device profiles.</li>
	<li>6.	Repeat 3-4 till end – Take up next page and keep working on conversion till end.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Here is sample of React web application design and development</h3>
<p>
We used a free html template <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/template/the-conference/" rel="noindex nofollow" target="_blank">The Conference from colorlib</a> as a starting point. After our <a href="https://www.faciletechnolab.com/software-development-technology/react-development" title="react web application design and development">react web application design and development</a>. You can <a href="https://faciletechnolab.github.io">See demo or download it here</a>

<br/>
<a href="https://faciletechnolab.github.io/" rel="noindex nofollow" target="_blank">The Conference react web application</a> is developed considering the practical usage. It is ready to use web application missing the <a href="https://expressjs.com/" rel="noindex nofollow" target="_blank">Express.js</a> back-end REST api that you can easily connect using Axios.js library in the front end.

<p>
Time needed for <a href="https://www.faciletechnolab.com/software-development-technology/react-development" title="react web application design">react web application design</a> really depends on number of pages, content elements on the page, size of the content on the page and many other aspects. But following is the average estimated time taken by our developer during our previous react web application design projects.<br/>
